## NeoVim

My NeoVim config is in [its own repo](https://github.com/Allaman/nvim/)

## Automatic configuration

I use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for automatic configuration of my devices and particularly [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) for managing my dotfiles.

- [rice](https://github.com/Allaman/rice) for my Arch Linux based configuration
- [mac-setup](https://github.com/Allaman/mac-setup) for my Mac based configuration
